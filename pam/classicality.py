    If given the preparations insphere radius, this will be equivalent to the

    if the insphere is that of the measurements, this should be interpreted as
    preparations classicality (program 6).

    This function does not check for valid preparations and measurements.
    You must make sure all Bloch vectors in `preps` are valid, with all the same
    dimensions, and likewise for the ones in `meas`.

    Args:
        preps (ndarray): row-wise Bloch vectors of density operators.
        meas (ndarray): Bloch vectors of measurement effects following. May be either
            given as ordered row-wise vectors e.g. `[Z0, Z1, X0, X1]` or nested as

Here we ask whether such a strong form of security could also be established for one-way (prepare and measure) QKD. While fully device-independent security is impossible, we show that security can be guaranteed against individual attacks in a semi-device-independent scenario. In the latter, the devices used by the trusted parties are non-characterized, but the dimensionality of the quantum systems used in the protocol is assumed to be bounded. Our security proof relies on the analogies between one-way QKD, dimension witnesses and random-access codes.},

However, not all entangled quantum states display nonlocality, and a central question is to determine the precise relation between entanglement and nonlocality. Here we present the first general test to decide whether a quantum state is local, and that can be implemented by semidefinite programming. This method can be applied to any given state and for the construction of new examples of states with local hidden-variable models for both projective and general measurements. As applications we provide a lower bound estimate of the fraction of two-qubit local entangled states and present new explicit examples of such states, including those which arise from physical noise models, Bell-diagonal states, and noisy GHZ and W states.},

This leads to a sequence of tests which, in the limit, fully capture the set of quantum states admitting a LHV model. Similar methods are developed for constructing local hidden state models.

We study what quantum measurements are projective simulable, that is, can be simulated by using projective measurements and classical randomness. We first prove that every measurement on a given quantum system can be realised by classical processing of projective measurements on the system plus an ancilla of the same dimension. Then, given a general measurement in dimension two or three, we show that deciding whether it is projective-simulable can be solved by means of semi-definite programming. We also establish conditions for the simulation of measurements using projective ones valid for any dimension. As an application of our formalism, we improve the range of visibilities for which two-qubit Werner states do not violate any Bell inequality for all measurements. From an implementation point of view, our work provides bounds on the amount of noise a measurement tolerates before losing any advantage over projective ones.},

The method allows one to construct both local hidden state (LHS) and local hidden variable (LHV) models, and can be applied to arbitrary entangled states in principle. Here we develop an improved implementation of the algorithm, discussing the optimization of the free parameters. For the case of two-qubit states, we design a ready-to-use optimized procedure. This allows us to construct LHS models (for projective measurements) that are almost optimal, as we show for Bell diagonal states, for which the optimal model has recently been derived. Finally, we show how to construct fully analytical local models, based on the output of the convex optimization procedure.},

	abstract = {We prove that quantum random access code (QRAC) performs better than its classical counterpart only when incompatible quantum measurements are used in the decoding task. As a consequence, evaluating the average success probability for QRAC provides a semi-device independent test for the detection of quantum incompatibility. We further demonstrate that any incompatible pair of projective measurements gives an advantage over all classical strategies. Finally, we establish a connection between the maximal average success probability for QRAC and earlier quantities introduced to assess incompatibility.},
